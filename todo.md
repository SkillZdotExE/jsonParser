# Up next

* Check for errors in json string
* Tidy up the interface (Maybe hide some public functions?)
* setup gh-pages with doxygen
* Iterators for JsonArray and JsonObject?

# Discarded for now

* Remove necessity to write string values as "\\"value\\"" (instead as "value")


> Reason: Too time-consuming, just enforce the standard of writing strings as "\\"value\\""
