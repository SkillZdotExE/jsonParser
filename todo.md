# Up next

* Editing options for JsonArray
* Check for errors in json string
* Tidy up the interface (Maybe hide some public functions?)

# Discarded for now
* Remove necessity to write string values as "\\"value\\"" (instead as "value")

> Reason: Too time-consuming, just enforce the standard of writing strings as "\\"value\\""
